Src / Tests
===================
Suggested structure (`tests` being the current directory):

```
tests
├── client
├── e2e
└── server
```

Client Tests
------------
Create a `client` directory in this directory and place your Angular unit tests, mocks, and spec files in it.

Server Tests
------------
Optionally, you may want to place any server-related tests in a `server` directory.

e2e Tests
---------
Place any e2e tests in a `e2e` directory.
